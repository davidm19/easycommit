Tired of having to type all that git stuff? Make your commit process easier!

NOTE: To make easier use of this file, make the file hidden (i.e. put a period in front of the name of the file) and make an alias in your .bash_profile or .bashrc (i.e. alias easycommit="./easycommit.sh")

ANOTHER NOTE: The only bad part about there is no tab completion as of yet; all files need to be types in completion.

ANOTHER NOTE: Credit to git-completion.bash goes to Shawn O. Pearce <spearce@spearce.org>
